## How to install the AnyTrack GTM Template
Assuming you already have Google Tag Manager installed on your website, the process is very much like adding an other tag.
1. Add a New Tag
2. Search "anytrack" from the Google Tag Manager Gallery
3. Add the template
4. Copy your AnyTrack property ID from your AnyTrack Dashboard
5. Paste it in the Property ID field
6. Save
7. Add a Triggering Option - All Page Views
8. Save and publish your container.

**Notes**: AnyTrack automatically instruments onsite engagements like `OutboundClicks`, `FormSubmit`, `AddToCart`, and other standard eCommerce Events. So you do not have to trigger the AnyTrack tag, unless you know otherwise.
